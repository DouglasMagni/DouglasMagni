### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


<p>I'm Douglas Post, a recent graduate from a tech program in Auckland, known as Dev Academy Aotearoa. At Dev Academy, I acquired skills in building fullstack software applications in an Agile environment.
-  Iâ€™m currently working on my personal project called Tradie Tracker App.</p>
<p>The Tradie Tracker App is a web application designed to streamline job management for tradespeople. It allows users to efficiently manage their projects, clients, and tasks in one centralized platform.</p>
            <p>I brought up this idea from a real-world problem identified during a conversation with a friend of mine who lives in Sydney and manages his jobs and employees using Excel tables. After a long conversation, we defined a product that would meet his demands, and I decided to suggest that idea to my colleagues, who liked it and embarked on this project with me. It's something that I am proud of.</p>
